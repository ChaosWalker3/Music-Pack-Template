# Music-Pack-Template
A template Music Pack for my mod State-based Dynamic Music for Ravenfield.

Greetings!

Download it by clicking on the big green Code button and then click Download ZIP.
After downloading it, check the https://ravenfieldgame.com/modding.html website to see what Unity version to use and also get the RFTools package from there.
Open Unity, first import the RFTools package, then the template package. There are some guide pictures for you inside the template folder but it should be easy to figure out.


If you have any trouble, please tell me by commenting on the State-based Dynamic Music mod page!
